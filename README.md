#### THIS REPOSITORY IS SUPPLEMENTARY MATERIAL TO APACHE-CAMEL-MASTERCLASS COURSE ON UDEMY

*Apache camel* is genuinely an excellent technology within the integration domain, and by the end of this course, I genuinely believe you will be amazed at everything Apache Camel has to offer

Apache Camel is an open-source enterprise integration patterns platform built on the book of the same name by Gregor Hohpe and Bobby Woolf.

It has been around for more than a decade now, with active development still in the works.

This course is by no means attempting to provide a full-scope coverage of what Apache Camel has to offer

But we cover a lot of ground here. By the end of this course, you would have looked at all significant aspects of Enterprise Application development like design, legacy-system migration, exception handling, logging, database management, etc.

This course is designed as a hands-on exercise where the expectation is for you to build along to understand property-based behaviour changes with Camel better.

We will be starting by building a legacy file-based data transfer application and then migrating this to a REST-based API to collect data. Distribution of this data would then be done using messaging buses like ActiveMQ.

The course is structured so that almost all lectures start with theoretical concepts followed by hands-on development.

A couple of mid-section exercises will firm your understanding of the concepts.
